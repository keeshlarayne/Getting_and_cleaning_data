Dataset info
=================
The experiments were carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, 
LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and 
gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 
50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has 
been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the 
training data and 30% the test data. 
For each record it is provided:

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals
(tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were 
calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag,
tBodyGyroJerkMag). A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ,
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (

Also included is the "Subject" vraiable, a factor variable from 1-30 denoting the subject id, and "Activity", 
a factor variable denoting which of the six activities was being performed (activities are "WALKING",
"WALKING_UPSTAIRS", "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS", "SITTING", "STANDING", "LAYING").
